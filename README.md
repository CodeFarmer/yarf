# yarf

A Clojure library designed as a basis for Roguelike games, for example
7 Day Roguelike entries.

Games can be developed in Clojure or in CLojureScript. They can have
graphical (tiled) interfaces or display text via the clj-lanterna and
Curses.

This is an experiment in using Claude Code to build something that is
intended as a reusable component, rather than an application or a
proof of concept.
