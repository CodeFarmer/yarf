# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

YARF (Yet Another Roguelike Framework) is a Clojure library for building roguelike games. It supports both Clojure and ClojureScript, with graphical (tiled) interfaces or text-based display using clj-lanterna and Curses.

This project is an experiment in using Claude Code to build a reusable component rather than an application.

## Build Commands

This is a Leiningen-based Clojure project.

```bash
lein repl          # Start REPL (enters yarf.core namespace)
lein test          # Run all tests
lein uberjar       # Build executable JAR
```

## Project Structure

- `src/yarf/` - Main source code
- `test/yarf/` - Test suite (mirrors src structure)
- `doc/` - Documentation
- `project.clj` - Leiningen configuration

## Development Notes
